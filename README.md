# My leetcode Solutions
This repo's purpose is for me to have all my leetcode submissions uploaded somewhere anyone can easily check rather than just have them on leetcode.

Note that my language preference is Kotlin at the moment, but I will sometimes use other languages such as Swift, C#, javascript, Rust or C/C++, which I will also upload if I ever code a solution in more than one language.

This is my leetcode account, in case anyone wants to check it out: [DaniGM](https://leetcode.com/danigm/)
